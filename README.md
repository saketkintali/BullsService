#This is a code sample which i have written for showing my understanding and implementation levels of controllers and services. I have successfully seperated the repetitive code from controller and placed it in a service and passed that service as a dependency injection in controller. I also have used json file to pull all data and put the code in service

#The main intent here is to make sure seperation of concerns is properly being addressed.

##controller and service seperately being called.
##instead of copying the data from controller, saved the data to a json file and called it through a service.
